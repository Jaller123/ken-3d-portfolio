# My 3D Portfolio

This is my second portfolio, which is an improved version of my old portfolio where I used a new tech stack such as ThreeJS and a new CSS framework, Tailwind, which allowed me to experiment with 3D models as well as explore my creative artistic style by designing a Cyberpunk neon-themed website.

I used Figma to create a small prototype of my idea of how the portfolio was supposed to look. However, throughout my process of making the portfolio, I took inspiration from other material on the internet, which shifted the design significantly from how it was originally designed.

<b>Here's a preview of the first prototype on Figma:</b>

<b>Finished version:</b>

As you can see, the first preview was quite different from the finished design, which became more of a continuation and update of my old portfolio. I was unsure of what theme to go with at the start, even though it was clear I wanted to implement a 3D model due to my previous education as a Virtual Reality Developer.

Overall, I was happy with the result. It took me almost three months to finish, and I worked on it in parallel with my internship and while job hunting after I graduated.
