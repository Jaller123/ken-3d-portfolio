      "AMS is a fullstack app made in my internship with two of my classmates where we all built this project together. It's a tool for developers and testers to create and simulate mock APIs, making it easier to test systems when real services are missing, unfinished, or hard to access. It supports custom requests, responses, scenarios, and traffic logs through a simple interface. I used HTML, CSS, Figma, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, Docker and Cypress to build this project.",

The app was an early exploration into AR interaction and user experience, and it helped me understand how to integrate virtual elements into the real world. While I didn’t use GitHub at the time and don’t have the source code available, the app is still saved on my phone. Feel free to reach out if you'd like a live demo.",
